Shapes Java Program
This Java program implements a generic Shapes interface to define various geometric shapes such as circle, rectangle, square, sphere, cylinder, and pyramid. Each shape class implements methods to calculate its area, perimeter (where applicable), and volume (for 3D shapes).

Assignment Description
The program includes the following components:

Shapes Interface (Shape.java):
Declares abstract methods for calculating the shape's area and perimeter.

Provides a non-abstract method to display the selected shape.

Concrete Shape Classes:

Circle (Circle.java):
Implements Shape and Volume interfaces.

Calculates area and perimeter of a circle.

Rectangle (Rectangle.java):

Implements Shape interface.

Calculates area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Square (Square.java):
Implements Shape interface.

Calculates area and perimeter of a square.

Sphere (Sphere.java):

Implements Shape and Volume interfaces.

Calculates surface area and volume of a sphere.

Cylinder (Cylinder.java):
Implements Shape and Volume interfaces.

Calculates surface area and volume of a cylinder.

Pyramid (Pyramid.java):

Implements Shape and Volume interfaces.

Calculates surface area and volume of a pyramid.

Main Class (Main.java):
Implements a menu-driven interface using Scanner for user interaction.

Provides options to select a shape and calculate its area, perimeter, and volume (where applicable).
